# LidDrivenCavity
2D Lid Driven Cavity is a Benchmark Problem in CFD to test different codes and numerical techniques to solve incompressible **Navier-Stokes** Equation. This problem is very popular among CFD enthusiast mainly because of the simplicity of the computation domain and Boundary conditions which are easily incorporated in codes.  


# Computational Fluid Dynamics(CFD)


Computational Fluid Dynamics(CFD) is all about **predicting the behaviour of the fluid particles**. CFD combines the core concepts of Fluid Dynamics and Numerical Methods to solve the fundamental fluid equations that govern the behaviour of the fluid particles and in the process, taking aid from computer programming. 

The complexity of the solution at high Reynold Number(Re) has tested the power of high end hardwares and so incur the need to optimize the codes for time and power consumption.In computational world, great amount of emphasis is given on **time** and **power consumption**. So, whenever someone wants to try something new or to test some new techniques and to see how different techniques help to reach convergence faster or which techniques is best suited to tackle non-linear terms, they make the use of Lid Driven Cavity problem to try all those things.


# Navier Stokes Equation


Navier Stokes Equation are the fundamental equations in Fluid Dynamics.
