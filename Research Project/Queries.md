About the velocity boundary condition. In the code, the right boundary of the domain is given velocity in the right direction(x-direction).
Shouldn't this be the top boundary.....(Got it)

Why do we need to put pressure of the boundary and the penultimate boundary nodes equal to each other?Although i have added some comment
in the LID_DRIVEN_CAVITY_VERSION1.m file [a link](https://github.com/AbdulHannanRaja95/LidDrivenCavity/blob/LID_CAVITY_VERSION1.m/Research%20Project/LID_CAVITY.m)

Why center difference scheme is not used for the vorticity computation?
