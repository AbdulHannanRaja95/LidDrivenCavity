# 12 steps to Navier Stokes Eqaution Using MATLAB

This section deals with the solution of navier stokes equation using MATLAB. All the information regarding these steps is taken from
Lorena Barba. Lorena Barba used Pyhton to solve the Partial Differential Equations however I intend to use MATLAB to solve the
equations.
